歡迎來到《由下而上學習計算機科學》！

Welcome to Computer Science from the Bottom Up

## 哲學 (Philosophy)

簡而言之，你正在閲讀的是計算機科學課程。年輕的計算機科學學生被教導“駕駛”計算機;但是你要去哪裡學習引擎蓋下的東西呢?不幸的是，理解操作系統並不像打開引擎蓋那麼容易。當前的Linux內核運行數百萬行代碼，再加上現代操作系統的其他關鍵部分(編譯器、彙編器和系統庫)，您的代碼庫就變得難以想像了。更進一步，添加一個大學水平的操作系統課程(或4個)，一些好的參考手冊，2到3年的C經驗，也許，你能弄清楚從哪裡開始理解這一切。

<!--
In a nutshell, what you are reading is intended to be a shop class for computer science. Young computer science students are taught to "drive" the computer; but where do you go to learn what is under the hood? Trying to understand the operating system is unfortunately not as easy as just opening the bonnet. The current Linux kernel runs into the millions of lines of code, add to that the other critical parts of a modern operating system (the compiler, assembler and system libraries) and your code base becomes unimaginable. Further still, add a University level operating systems course (or four), some good reference manuals, two or three years of C experience and, just maybe, you might be able to figure out where to start looking to make sense of it all.

為了保持與汽車的類比，這位準學生開始嘗試在不知道二衝程馬達如何運作的情況下使用一級方程式引擎。在他們的車間課上，學生應該拉開，扭轉，旋轉，並把兩個衝程發動機放在一起，因此有一個很好的框架來理解一級方程式發動機是如何工作的。沒有人會期望他們成為一級方程式工程師，但他們已經在路上了!

<!--
To keep with the car analogy, the prospective student is starting out trying to work on a Formula One engine without ever knowing how a two stroke motor operates. During their shop class the student should pull apart, twist, turn and put back together that two stroke motor, and consequentially have a pretty good framework for understanding just how the Formula One engine works. Nobody will expect them to be a Formula One engineer, but they are well on their way!

## 為什麼要從下至上? (Why from the bottom up?)

並不是每個人都想參加商店課程。大多數人只想開車，不知道怎麼從零開始造一輛。顯然，任何普通的計算機課程都必須考慮到這一點，否則它將與學生無關。所以計算機科學是從上到下的;應用程序，高級編程，軟件設計和開發理論，可能的數據結構。學生們可能會接觸到二進制的，希望是二進制的邏輯，甚至可能是一些低級的概念，比如寄存器，操作碼等等。

<!--
Not everyone wants to attend shop class. Most people only want to drive the car, not know how to build one from scratch. Obviously any general computing curriculum has to take this into account else it won't be relevant to its students. So computer science is taught from the "top down"; applications, high level programming, software design and development theory, possibly data structures. Students will probably be exposed to binary, hopefully binary logic, possibly even some low level concepts such as registers, opcodes and the like at a superficial level.

這本書的目標是完全相反的方向，工作從操作系統的基礎到如何編譯和執行這些應用程序。

<!--
This book aims to move in completely the opposite direction, working from operating systems fundamentals through to how those applications are complied and executed.

## 支持技術 (Enabling Technologies)

由於開源技術的發展，這本書才有可能出版。在Linux出現之前，這就像開著一輛關著引擎蓋的汽車上一門工廠課程;今天，我們可以打開引擎蓋，用它的內部，更好的是，用它來做我們想做的任何事情。

<!--
This book is only possible thanks to the development of Open Source technologies. Before Linux it was like taking a shop course with a car that had its bonnet welded shut; today we are in a position to open that bonnet, poke around with the insides and, better still, take that engine and use it to do whatever we want.
